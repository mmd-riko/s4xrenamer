As the name suggests, this is a Blender addon that renames Sims 4 weights/bones for X-mirror editing... Test version.
This will align bone rules with Blender's X-mirror, making weight and rigging adjustments much easier.
You can revert to the original state with a single button and resend to Sims 4 Studio.

Supports multiple languages. 8 major languages. For now, I think it's fine as long as you can use English.



This works from Blender 4.x onwards.

Lower versions have not been tested. It has been tested on 4.23 and 4.5.



⚠️Caution⚠️

This will cause irreversible changes and cannot be guaranteed to return to normal. We recommend saving with a new name before doing this.





How to Use



This assumes some familiarity with Blender. Basic questions will be ignored.

You should be able to load the zip file by simply specifying it or by dragging and dropping it, but if that doesn't work, try downloading it directly from the preferences.



Select a bone.

In the N Keys tab, look for S4 Rename, which appears when you select an object.

Simply press the Convert button above.

⚠For some reason, the results show 0 vertex group changes, but in fact, all meshes were successfully converted.



You'll now be able to rig X-mirror editing.

To revert, select the bone again and click Revive.

Check to see if it's back to normal.



To avoid this rigging rename, delete the armature assignment.
If necessary, simply assign an armature.







I'm really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really sorry, but I'm not very good at programming, so this was created using the ChatGPT-5 feature at https://github.com/. I'm really sorry that we had to rely on AI. If you have any complaints about the generated AI, please make this official and properly align it. 

I don't claim any personal rights with this addon, but I'll be fired if I hide it behind a paywall.
