# s4xrenamer
As the name suggests, this is a Blender addon that renames Sims 4 weights/bones for X-mirror editing... Test version. This will align bone rules with Blender's X-mirror, making weight and rigging adjustments much easier. You can revert to the original state with a single button and resend to Sims 4 Studio.
